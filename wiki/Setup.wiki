#summary How to configure your project

===java===

This project is really easy to configure as the dependency is a war containing a simple javascript file and a jar which includes all the web configuration (using web fragment from servlet 3.0 specification).
[ConfigurableProperties Some properties] are exposed as MBeans and can be changed at runtime and others can be set directly in the javascript.

Just define the maven dependency:
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.am</groupId>
	<artifactId>java-large-file-uploader</artifactId>
	<version>1.0-RC1</version>
	<type>war</type>
	<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
}}}
And the repository:
{{{
<repository>
	<id>java large file uploader repository</id>
	<url>http://java-large-file-uploader.googlecode.com/svn/mvnrepo</url>
</repository>
}}}
And do not forget to specify `version="3.0"` in the `web-app` element of your web.xml !
